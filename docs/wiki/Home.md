## 💡 About the Project

SARDIN-AI was born from a need to modernize cooperative fishing. We believe that by providing enterprise-grade intelligence to independent fishermen, we can:

1. **Reduce Costs**: Through route optimization.
2. **Increase Safety**: With AI-powered weather alerts.
3. **Ensure Sustainability**: By targeting specific zones and reducing bycatch.
