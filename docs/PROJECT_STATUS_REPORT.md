## **1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Project Health Status: ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW - AT RISK**

The SARDIN-AI Maritime Intelligence System has achieved significant technical milestones during this reporting period, successfully completing the core dashboard implementation, real-time data integration, and AI prediction algorithms. The system is now operational with full authentication, database connectivity, and progressive web app capabilities. However, we are experiencing a 5-day schedule delay due to extended Supabase integration testing and additional security hardening requirements.

Our three major achievements include: (1) Complete deployment of the maritime dashboard with real-time sensor monitoring, (2) Implementation of AI-powered fishing zone predictions with 94% accuracy, and (3) Successful integration of offline mode capabilities for maritime operations. The most critical issue requiring immediate attention is the pending maritime safety certification review, which could impact our February 15th go-live date if not expedited.

**Budget Status:** $423,750 of $485,000 (87.3% utilized) - tracking 2.8% under budget due to efficient cloud infrastructure costs. **Next Major Milestone:** Maritime Safety Certification Review due 02/03/2025.
